            I am an aspiring software engineer interested in politics and history. Being of Turkish background, I found this project to be interesting in finding out about how Turkey became a republic from one of the longest lasting empires (Ottoman Empire). Atatürk had a massive influence with his revolution. I wanted to find out more as to how and why Atatürk created the republic. This was initially made to only be a timeline website on Atatürk but I had been persuaded into creating a whole website dedicated to Atatürk instead. As a result I added more features such as the "Quotes" section. I hope that this website can now be used to gather information on Atatürk and also learn more about his vision of Turkey.
